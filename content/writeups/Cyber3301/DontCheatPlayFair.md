# Don't cheat, play fair

The title gives away that it's a playfair cipher, '`play fair`' should hint that the key is the word fair. 

You can use a tool to decrypt it, giving the clue `dragon chicken is my favourite`

This was the only round of the treasure hunt which required you to visit a physical place in insti. 

Hopefully dragon chicken set you off to go to zaitoon.

The poem, was once again, encrypted in playfair with the keyword 'fair' 

Gives you a poem with the first letters of every line spelling
		
		A
		C
		R
		O
		S
		T
		I
		C

Acrostic poems give you a message when you **join the first letters** of each line.

This is unrelated to zaitoon, but hopefully set you off in the general direction of joining first letters of menu items for the password 

The section with dragon chicken on the menu would give you `dccdcchccpgg`
